# Examples
All examples share common structure. All can be run with run.sh script and all use run_config.py.

Datasets used in examples are:

* toy_reader_NQ_train.jsonl
  * training dataset with top ranked passages
* toy_reader_NQ_dev.jsonl
  * validation dataset with top ranked passages
* toy_unfiltered.jsonl
  * data for filtering example
    
Take on mind that those are just toy examples. The trained models will have poor performance.
